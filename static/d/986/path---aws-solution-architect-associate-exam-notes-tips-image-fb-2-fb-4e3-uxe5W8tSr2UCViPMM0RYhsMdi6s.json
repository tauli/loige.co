I have been using a variety of AWS services professionally in the last 3 years, so I was optimistically expecting this practical experience to be enough. In reality, I had to spend some time to study and fill some gaps about important topics or details that I never had to deal with during my professional experience.</p>\n<p>In this article, I will try to recap some of the topics I believe are important to know for this specific certification with a particular focus on things that I struggled a bit to remember or that I generally tripped over during the quiz simulations.</p>\n<p>Hopefully, if you are preparing for the same certification, this article will be helpful to you! 😊</p>\n<h2 id=\"mindset\"><a href=\"#mindset\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Mindset</h2>\n<p>The exam is a classic quiz where you have to pick one or more answers. It’s very easy to find simulations online, so you might be tempted to spend your time just doing that and use the quiz experience as a way to learn what’s necessary to pass the exam.</p>\n<p>While this might be good to understand the style of the questions and the depth of the topics covered, you shouldn’t try to learn specific questions and answers by heart. In fact, studying quiz questions and memorizing answer is NOT a good study technique and it will be likely reducing your chances of passing the exam, rather than increasing it!</p>\n<p>All the questions are quite reasonable, if you understood the theory behind all the different AWS services and you know the most important details (in terms of costs, configuration, availability, durability, etc.), you should be able to figure out the right answers.</p>\n<p>I admit some questions might be tricky. For instance, you might get questions where more than one answer seems to be correct. In those cases, it might be helpful to try to reason by exclusion and look for all the answers that are definitely wrong. If this is still not helping you to come up to a definitive answer, you can still “flag” the question (yeah, that’s an option in the examination platform) and come back to it later with a fresher mind.</p>\n<p>Managing your time will be important too. Try not to spend more than 2 or 3 minutes per question. If you feel you are spending too much time on a question, again, you can flag it and come back to it later when you addressed all the others. In short, make sure you addressed all the questions you feel sure about and save some time to address and review the ones you are struggling with. Sometimes, a bit more reasoning will help you identify some key detail you were initially missing to unlock the right answer.</p>\n<h2 id=\"study-and-exercise-material\"><a href=\"#study-and-exercise-material\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Study and exercise material</h2>\n<p>I used a number of different sources to prepare for the exam.\nThe mandatory place to start with is the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-associate/\">official AWS Solution Architect Associate certification page</a>. In this page you will find all the necessary details about the certification and links to the two most important official (FREE) resources:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/well-architected/\">The AWS Well-architected framework</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://d0.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/AWS_Cloud_Best_Practices.pdf\">Best practices: architecting for the cloud</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>I also used other unofficial resources. A big shout out goes to <a href=\"https://acloud.guru/\">A Cloud Guru</a>, which offers a subscription that allows to watch all video series for all sorts of AWS certifications. In my personal opinion, the format of the courses is great. It is particularly focused on explaining the fundamental principles of every single service but it is also very practical in underlining what’s really important to know in order to be ready the exam. Their platform also offers per topic quiz and exercises, but also a complete exam simulation app.</p>\n<p>In the last few days of my preparation, I also found an interesting (and FREE) Android app called <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.magycbytes.aws\">\nAWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate (by Magic Bytes Soft)</a>. The app offers nice features to test your knowledge like flash cards and test sessions.</p>\n<p>Finally, when you feel confident enough with the exam simulations, it might be a good idea to tackle the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/training/\">official exam simulation by AWS Training</a> (paid) to have a better feeling of what the platform looks like and what kind of questions can you expect.</p>\n<p>Take into account that some practical experience with AWS is very important. Of course you can understand all the concepts only at a theoretical level, but practice will be very important to fix those concepts in your mind and to understand why many details are important. So be sure you spend some time playing around with all the services you might not have used yet. In those cases, I found that trying to build a little side project that involves those services is often the most complete and rewarding experience.</p>\n<h2 id=\"my-notes\"><a href=\"#my-notes\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>My Notes</h2>\n<p>Here’s a collection of notes that I took during my studies, somewhat organized by topic/service.
