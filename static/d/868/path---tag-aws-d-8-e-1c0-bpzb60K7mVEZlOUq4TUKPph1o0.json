I recently took this certification and I have to admit it was a little bit more challenging than I originally expected. I have been using a variety of AWS services professionally in the last 3 years, so I was optimistically expecting this practical experience to be enough. In reality, I had to spend some time to study and fill some gaps about important…","fields":{"slug":"aws-solution-architect-associate-exam-notes-tips"},"frontmatter":{"date":"21 October, 2018","title":"AWS Solution Architect Associate exam, my notes and tips","tags":["aws"],"header_img":{"publicURL":"/static/aws-solution-architect-associate-exam-notes-tips-9f3b3348d4b78e8768f5f47770f9891d.jpg"}}},{"timeToRead":6,"excerpt":"This article presents a quick tip that will help you deal with the content of files in S3 through the AWS command line in a much faster and simpler way. Did you ever want to simply print the content of a file in S3 from your command line and maybe pipe the output to another command?

One of the requirements was to make the provisioning easy to reproduce over multiple environments, so we ended up playing a bit with Terraform, while obviously adopting OpenVPN for the VPN server. Another important requirement was to expose the OpenVPN web interface (also called Access Server) using an SSL, which I was expecting to be one of the most challenging things to automate, instead, it turned out to…","fields":{"slug":"using-lets-encrypt-and-certbot-to-automate-the-creation-of-certificates-for-openvpn"},"frontmatter":{"date":"19 June, 2017","title":"Using Let’s Encrypt and Certbot to automate the creation of certificates for OpenVPN","tags":["ssl","web","terraform","security","aws"],"header_img":{"publicURL":"/static/using-lets-encrypt-and-certbot-to-automate-the-creation-of-certificates-for-openvpn-loige-icover-image-45dfcbcf12ab7cac8a20f867207af385.jpg"}}}],"tag":"aws"}}
