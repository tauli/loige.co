Hate speech will not be tolerated under any circumstances\n          </h3>\n\n          <p>\n            If you can&apos;t imagine saying something out loud in the middle of\n            a real-life coffee shop, you can&apos;t do that here. If you want to\n            call somebody something but wouldn&apos;t wear that on your t-shirt\n            to PAX, you can&apos;t do that here. We don&apos;t want to censor\n            anybody, but using hate speech or hateful or victimizing terms, even\n            as an innocent joke, are just not cool.\n          </p>\n\n          <p>\n            Examples: making rape jokes, using gay as a negative slur, being\n            homo/transphobic, stigmatizing minority groups with pseudoscience,\n            making fun of a new user&apos;s minor mistake to the point where\n            they never come back. Please treat others with the same respect you\n            were afforded when you joined us.\n          </p>\n\n          <h3 id=\"2dontpostnsfwcontentflametrollreadersadminsormoderators\">\n            2. Don&apos;t post NSFW content, flame, troll readers, admins, or\n            moderators\n          </h3>\n\n          <p>\n            If you attack an individual you&apos;ll be asked to go. Fight\n            topics, not people.\n          </p>\n\n          <p>\n            Of course, some content have NSFW elements and our editorial may\n            contain some as well - just use common sense.

If a mod decision is made and\n            you continue to come back at them, mock them, make memes, create\n            faux accounts, change your avatar, etc. You will be banned.

It&apos;s not edgy to talk about piracy.\n          </p>\n\n          <p>\n            Example: How to get around copyrighted material, how to modify\n            hardware, all that stuff is just too gray area or outright illegal.\n            I will delete this type of comments without notice.\n          </p>\n\n          <h3 id=\"4dontrepresentyourselfasstafforotherlivingpersons\">\n            4.

You are welcome to run any type of event\n            or contest on your personal blog that you would like, so long as it\n            could not be mistaken for an editorial feature of the same type\n            officially promoted by this website or other organisations.\n          </p>\n\n          <h3 id=\"5dontcopyandpasteotherpeoplesworkandpassitoffasyourowncontent\">\n            5.

Don&apos;t post copyrighted work.\n          </h3>\n\n          <p>\n            Examples: links with copyrighted content such as books, video\n            courses, magazine scans, embargoed screenshots, and other stuff that\n            isn&apos;t explicitly made available to the public.
